# 🔊 System Audio Capture Setup Guide

This guide helps you set up system audio capture for real-time transcription. Pluely captures your computer's audio output and automatically transcribes speech from videos, meetings, music, and any audio playing on your system.

## 🎯 What This Enables

System audio capture allows Pluely to transcribe:

- 🎥 **Meeting audio** (Zoom, Teams, Google Meet, Discord)
- 🎬 **Video content** (YouTube, Netflix, Twitch)
- 🎵 **Music and podcasts** (Spotify, Apple Music)
- 🎮 **Game audio and commentary**
- 📞 **VoIP calls** (Skype, WhatsApp)
- 📱 **Any audio playing on your computer**

## 🔒 Why Setup is Required

Your operating system doesn't allow applications to directly capture "system audio" for security and privacy reasons. Virtual audio devices create a secure bridge that routes your system audio to Pluely.

**This is the industry standard** - OBS Studio, Discord screen sharing, Zoom computer audio, and all professional audio apps require similar setup.

## 📋 Prerequisites & Dependencies

**Important**: Before setting up audio capture, ensure all required system dependencies are installed for your platform:

👉 **[Tauri Prerequisites & Dependencies](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/)**

This includes essential packages like WebKitGTK (Linux), system libraries, and other dependencies required for Tauri applications to run properly on your operating system.

### Option 2: VB-Audio Virtual Cable (If Stereo Mix unavailable)

**What is VB-Audio Virtual Cable?** A free virtual audio driver that creates virtual input/output devices.

**Step-by-step setup:**

1. **Download and Install**:

   - Visit: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/
   - Download **"VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device"**
   - **Important**: Right-click installer → **"Run as Administrator"**
   - Follow installation wizard
   - **Restart computer** (required)

2. **Configure Audio Routing**:

   - Right-click speaker icon → **"Sounds"** → **"Playback"** tab
   - Right-click **"CABLE Input"** → **"Set as Default Device"**
   - Now your system audio goes to the virtual cable

3. **Optional - Hear Audio Too**:
   - Go to **"Recording"** tab
   - Right-click **"CABLE Output"** → **"Properties"**
   - **"Listen"** tab → Check **"Listen to this device"**
   - Select your speakers from dropdown

**✅ Verification**: You should see "CABLE Output" as an available input device in Pluely.

## 🐧 Linux Setup

### PulseAudio Monitor (Most Common)

**What are Monitor Devices?** Built-in virtual inputs that capture what's playing through your speakers - Linux's transparent approach to system audio capture.

**Step-by-step setup:**

1. **Check for Existing Monitor Devices**:

   ```bash
   # List all audio sources
   pactl list sources short

   # Look for devices ending with ".monitor"
   pactl list sources short | grep monitor
   ```

2. **If Monitor Devices Found**:

   - Great! They should work automatically with Pluely
   - Skip to testing section below

3. **If No Monitor Devices Found**:

   ```bash
   # Install PulseAudio utilities (Ubuntu/Debian)
   sudo apt install pulseaudio-utils

   # For Fedora/CentOS
   sudo dnf install pulseaudio-utils

   # For Arch Linux
   sudo pacman -S pulseaudio
   ```

4. **Create Loopback Module** (if still no monitors):

   ```bash
   # Create temporary loopback
   pactl load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1

   # Make it permanent
   echo "load-module module-loopback latency_msec=1" >> ~/.config/pulse/default.pa

   # Restart PulseAudio
   pulseaudio -k && pulseaudio --start
   ```

**✅ Verification**: Run `pactl list sources short | grep monitor` - you should see monitor devices listed.

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

### Step-by-Step Testing

1. **Open Pluely Application**

2. **Access System Audio**:

   - Click the **system audio button** (headphones icon in Pluely)
   - The button should be visible in the main interface

3. **Start System Audio Capture**:

   - Click **"🔄 System Audio"** button
   - Pluely will attempt to detect your virtual audio device

4. **Test Audio Playback**:

   - Play some **music, video, or speech** on your computer
   - Use YouTube, Spotify, or any audio source

5. **Verify Capture**:
   - You should see **audio activity** in Pluely
   - Look for **transcription text** appearing
   - Check that the **audio visualizer** shows movement

### Debug Tools (If Issues)

- **"🔍 Debug Devices"** - Lists all available audio input devices
- **"🎵 Test Audio"** - Tests audio levels for 3 seconds and shows RMS values
- **Console Output** - Check for messages like "Selected virtual audio device: [Device Name]"

### Expected Results

**✅ Working Correctly:**

- You see audio activity and waveforms
- Transcription text appears when speech is detected
- Console shows: "Selected virtual audio device: BlackHole 2ch" (or similar)

**❌ Not Working:**

- No audio activity detected
- RMS values remain at 0.000000
- No transcription appears
- Error messages about device detection

### What Each Platform Should Show

## 🆘 Need Help?

1. Use Pluely's built-in **"🔍 Debug"** and **"🎵 Test Audio"** tools
2. Check console output for specific error messages
3. Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. Try **"🎤 Use Microphone"** as fallback if system audio setup fails

**Remember:** This setup is required for all system audio capture applications - it's not specific to Pluely but a universal requirement for security reasons.
